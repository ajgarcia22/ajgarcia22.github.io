        <p>My name is Armando Garcia and I am born and raised in San Jose, California. I have never lived in another place outside California. That doesn't mean I haven't traveled. I have been to places like Washington D.C, Oregon,Hawaii and to Nevada. As you can tell I love to travel. Another thing I love is Dogs. I am a dog person with 4 dogs.</p>

         <p> I have been in school my whole life. I started off in Cassell Elementary but moved to Rocketship because it was a better school for me. From Rocketship I got invited to go to the school Alpha Blanca Alvarado. There I learned so much and improved a lot in reading and math.Then after the Middle School ended i decided to stay with Alpha and go to the Alpha Highschool. Here I am learning so much and I'm thankful for all the amazing teachers that help me in school.
